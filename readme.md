#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software and tools installed on your machine:

- **Git**: You can download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

#### Clone the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.

3. Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git by running the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hamzeh01/loopstudious.git
   ```

#### Navigate to the Project Folder

1. Change your current directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd loopstudious
   ```

#### Launch a Local Development Server

1.  To view the project locally, you'll need a development server. If you don't have one installed, you can use tools like "Live Server" for Visual Studio Code or "lite-server" for other code editors.

2.  Start your local development server by running the following command (replace with your specific tool):

    ```bash
    # For Visual Studio Code with Live Server
    code .
    # Then right-click on your HTML file and choose "Open with Live Server"
    # For lite-server (global installation)
    npm install -g lite-server
    lite-server
    ```

3.  Open your web browser and access the project by navigating to http://localhost:your-port-number.

        The default port for many development servers is 3000, so you can access the project at http://localhost:3000. If your server uses a different port, replace your-port-number with the actual port number.

    Now you have successfully installed and launched the project on your local machine. You can start exploring and making modifications as needed.
